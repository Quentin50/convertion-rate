### Objective
We organized a Supervised machine learning challenge for our promotion students. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm in order to predict the conversion rate on a website. Conversion rate i.e. "will the customer buy a product or not?".  
- Try different algorithms
- Train the best algorithm on all data
- Deliver predictions on a test set

## Dataset
Dataset from Jedha: TODO
